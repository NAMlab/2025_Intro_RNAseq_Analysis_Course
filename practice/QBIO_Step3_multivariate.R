# Introduction to this script -----------
# this script walks thorough techniques for data exploration and expands on last week's data wrangling theme
# we'll also continue to create publication-quality graphics
# This script starts with your filtered and normalized abundance data from the Step 2 script.

# install.packages('gt')


# Load packages ------
library(tidyverse) # you're familiar with this fromt the past two lectures
library(DT) # for making interactive tables
library(plotly) # for making interactive plots
library(gt) # A layered 'grammar of tables' - think ggplot, but for tables

# Identify variables of interest in study design file ----
targets
group <- targets$tissue
group <- factor(group)

# Prepare your data -------
# for this part of the class you'll use your normalized and filtered data in log2 cpm
# make sure you have this object already in your work environment
# if you don't, go back to the Step2 script and generate it
log2.cpm.filtered.norm.df

# Hierarchical clustering ---------------
#hierarchical clustering can only work on a data matrix, not a data frame
#try using filtered and unfiltered data...how does this change the result?
#try other distance methods (e.g. switch from 'maximum' to 'euclidean')...how does this change the result?
distance <- dist(t(log2.cpm.filtered.norm), method = "euclidean") #other distance methods are "euclidean", maximum", "manhattan", "canberra", "binary" or "minkowski"
clusters <- hclust(distance, method = "complete") #other agglomeration methods are "ward.D", "ward.D2", "single", "complete", "average", "mcquitty", "median", or "centroid"
plot(clusters, labels=sampleLabels)

# Principal component analysis (PCA) -------------
pca.res <- prcomp(t(log2.cpm.filtered.norm), scale.=F, retx=T)
#look at the PCA result (pca.res) that you just created
ls(pca.res)
summary(pca.res) # Prints variance summary for all principal components.
pca.res$rotation #$rotation shows you how much each gene influenced each PC (called 'scores')
pca.res$x # 'x' shows you how much each sample influenced each PC (called 'loadings')
#note that these have a magnitude and a direction (this is the basis for making a PCA plot)
screeplot(pca.res) # A screeplot is a standard way to view eigenvalues for each PCA
pc.var<-pca.res$sdev^2 # sdev^2 captures these eigenvalues from the PCA result
pc.per<-round(pc.var/sum(pc.var)*100, 1) # we can then use these eigenvalues to calculate the percentage variance explained by each PC
pc.per

# Visualize your PCA result ------------------
#lets first plot any two PCs against each other
#We know how much each sample contributes to each PC (loadings), so let's plot
pca.res.df <- as_tibble(pca.res$x)
ggplot(pca.res.df) +
  aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, label=sampleLabels) + # color = group
  geom_point(size=4) +
  geom_label() +
  # stat_ellipse() +
  xlab(paste0("PC1 (",pc.per[1],"%",")")) + 
  ylab(paste0("PC2 (",pc.per[2],"%",")")) +
  labs(title="PCA plot",
       caption=paste0("produced on ", Sys.time())) +
  # coord_fixed() +
  theme_bw()

# Let's discuss and iteratively refine the PCA code and plot from above
# First, take note of the fact that we can use information from our PCA analysis to label our axes
# Remember that PCA is unsupervised, so knows nothing about group assignment (healthy vs disease)
# But *we* know, and so we can use this knowledge to enhance the plot.  Add a 'color=group' mapping to the aes of the plot above
# Can we figure out the identity of the outlier?  We have already provided samplelabel mapping in aes, so just uncomment the 'geom_label()'
# Uncomment 'coord_fixed()' to apply the correct aspect ratio
# Uncomment 'stat_ellipse()' to see how you can circle clusters on the PCA
# How would this PCA look if you used raw counts (myCounts) instead of log2 CPM?
# What are the disadvantages of looking at a PCA result using such a simple XY plot?

# Create a PCA 'small multiples' chart ----
# this is another way to view PCA laodings to understand impact of each sample on each pricipal component
pca.res.df <- pca.res$x[,1:4] %>% # note that this is the first time you've seen the 'pipe' operator from the magrittr package

                          values_to = "loadings") # name of new variable (column) storing all the values (data)
